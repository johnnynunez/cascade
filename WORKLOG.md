# Manipulation and assembly integration

Base: `1271d52d09feaa0edb4652d39a9ab21d69e4a686`.

User priority (2026-10-02): implement OVRTX/cuMotion in manipulation and
physical screw manipulation first; address acceptance trial 12 afterward;
update documentation last. The initial documentation-first interpretation
was corrected by the user.

## Capability mapping

| Capability | Skill / implementation | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ordered integration | isaac-sim-orchestrator | Isolated foundation checks, then combined runtime |
| Planned arm motion | manipulation-ik / motion-generation; cuMotion followup | Native SDK curve executed through normal SafeArm motion with live safety gates |
| Dynamic RGBD | isaac-camera; OVRTX followup | Physics-owned transforms, camera calibration, captured state and frame identity bound to returned pixels |
| Fastening physics | physics-simulation / manipulation-ik | Independently measured fastener rotation and axial advance; seating/torque claimed only when measured |
| Simulation QA | isaac-sim-validator | Focused regression, native runtime evidence, visible output and exact source binding |
| Lessons | skill-distillation | Record corrections and propose reusable updates; no unrequested skill writes |

## Ownership and environment

- Root owns this integration worktree and screw implementation.
- cuMotion and OVRTX agents work in separate `*-runtime-followup` worktrees.
- Original adapter worktrees are still changing in another session; snapshot
  their existing work, never modify or stop their owners.
- Two RTX PRO 6000 GPUs are present. Existing Isaac/GGX/occupancy processes
  belong to earlier sessions. New native checks must use separate owned
  processes and ports, without global termination or dependency changes.
- Trial 12 evidence has been audited read-only. Orange planning failed before
  actuation at the shared 3-second route preflight budget. Green cube passed;
  proof2/campaign were not completed. This is deferred until integration.

## Progress

OVRTX and cuMotion are integrated in the normal arm/skill path. The joint
green-object episode completed grasp, lift, transport, release, return home and
park with unchanged safety gates. Its runtime source was `f2b2186`; compact
receipts, native curve counts and corrected video frames are committed under
`benchmark/results/`. Pink-object failures remain visible, including the final
loaded joint-6 following error. The owned 8731/8732 simulators and OVRTX worker
were closed with process-identity receipts; no elevated payload was released.

The SO-101 Factory experiment completed physical threading, measured contact
at the spacer seat and two seconds of zero-motor retention. Positive, zero-drive,
half-timestep and failed bare-head seating results remain separate. Source and
asset hashes bind the saved solver-state video. Ordinary `turn_screw` remains
explicitly unverified for physical tightening.

Trial 12's historical green success/orange preflight failure and separate
terminal process-binding error are retained. The same-frame route replay saves
about one second by checking identical endpoint vetoes earlier. Both replay
versions pass on this host. The fresh 1280 native follow-up passed that route
stage and subsequently failed its 120-second physical streaming wall budget;
fresh cameras did not imply sufficient simulation throughput. Its owned
simulator was closed. A separate 640 variant retains all original motion,
perception and geometry limits; its final result belongs in the integration
report rather than overwriting trial 12.

The final production source `c07d922` passed 3,797 tests, 48 skipped and four
deselected. The later fixture-import lint cleanup passed 12 trajectory tests;
changed Python files pass Ruff F/E9. Documentation was reconciled after the
native manipulation and assembly work, as requested.

## Reusable lessons and skill proposals (dry run)

This records the `skill-distillation` pass in project documentation. No installed
skill-library files were modified, and the proposals are not promoted as applied
skill guidance.

- User priority is a dependency order: when corrected from documentation to
  implementation, complete and measure the implementation before reconciling
  the status report. Update the canonical report around final outcomes.
- Freeze loaded production source during a native run and during tests that
  inspect live function source. A shared editable environment does not identify
  the intended worktree; bind imports through its absolute source directory.
- Configure every resolved arm node, not just the top-level profile, when a
  diagnostic retargets its endpoint or park pose. Record effective flags and
  actual gate callbacks; a config key alone did not enable the observed gate.
- A native curve is only a candidate. Preserve independent corridor checks,
  original cancellation generation, final measured start-drift admission and
  retained load state across planning, failure and shutdown.
- A second USD stage inside Kit can still emit global notices affecting the
  physical stage. Export without stage edits and author renderer-only opinions
  in an isolated process; test global notice absence and live tensors.
- Measure contact continuity per physics substep. A contact seen in one rendered
  frame does not prove contact throughout that frame. Final tightening requires
  an identified support contact and a bounded motor-off rest, not just stalled
  rotation and motor effort. Retain zero-drive controls and collision failures.
- Native readiness, prompt-free perception and exact-label perception are
  distinct startup checks. Warm read-only perception in the same runtime;
  preserve expired-frame failures and require the task's own newer captures.
- Record physical time, wall time and target acknowledgement cadence together.
  A live camera and advancing simulation can still be too slow for a motion
  wall deadline. Treat resolution changes as explicit configuration variants.

Proposed library additions, pending a separately requested skill update:

| Owning skill / section | Proposed addition | Canonical project reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `isaac-sim-orchestrator/SKILL.md`, Phase 2 — Incremental integration | Freeze source per episode; audit effective resolved configuration and ownership | `docs/MANIPULATION_ASSEMBLY_20261002.md` |
| `physics-simulation/SKILL.md`, Troubleshooting | Distinguish thread-friction stall, real seat contact and per-substep tool interference | `sim/seating_verification.py`, `docs/FACTORY_THREAD_CONTACT.md` |
| `isaac-sim-validator/SKILL.md`, Universal checklist | Bind raw evidence and video to loaded source; separate startup, task and shutdown verdicts | native component receipts and `docs/LOCAL_RTX_VALIDATION.md` |

These proposals contain no embedded implementation and require no change to the
completed project work. Existing specialist references remain authoritative.
