# Roadmap

## Near term (before the demo)

- **Onsite bring-up checklist**
  1. `sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 1000000`; kill any
     motorbridge-gateway/Studio.
  2. Re-verify RS gripper travel + stall torque; update
     `configs/arms/rebot_rs.yaml` (open/closed rad, kp, max_width_m).
  3. Hand-eye calibration: run the baseline repo's `collect_handeye_eih.py`
     (eye-in-hand) or measure the static mount, point the camera profile's
     `extrinsics` at it.
  4. Fit the table plane once (`DepthProvider.fit_table_plane`) and set
     `table_z` / workspace AABB for the physical setup.
  5. `pytest -m hardware` (read-only), then first motions with
     `--arm rebot_rs` at low `max_joint_vel`.
- **Local LLM**: run `scripts/serve_qwen_llamacpp.sh` (Qwen3.6-27B GGUF, MTP
  speculative decoding) and rehearse with `--llm local_qwen` so the demo has
  a no-internet fallback. vLLM variant in `serve_qwen_vllm.sh`.
- **Visual embedder for memory**: plug a CLIP/SigLIP image encoder into
  `EpisodicMemory(embed_dim=...)` + crops per detection, enabling
  "the thing that looked like X" recall through the TurboQuant index.

## Mid term

- **VLA policy backend**: LingBot-VLA-v2 exposes a websocket policy server
  (msgpack-numpy, `infer(obs) -> action chunks`). Add a `VLAExecutor` behind
  the skill API so `grasp_object` can be served either by the deterministic
  OBB pipeline or by a language-conditioned policy; the agent layer stays
  unchanged. Spark caveats: flash-attn must build for aarch64+Blackwell or
  the two hardcoded attention impls patched to SDPA.
- **GraspNet-class 6-DoF grasps**: the baseline's graspnet path needs the
  vendored sdk + checkpoint-rs.tar and THC-era CUDA patches for torch 2.x.
  Alternative: a modern 6-DoF grasp head served as a `plan_grasp` skill.
- **Skill-library growth loop** (ASPIRE): after each failed→repaired run,
  distill the fix into `skills_library/*.md` (schema already implemented);
  load `relevant(task)` entries into the agent context.

## Long term: sim2real with NuRec / Isaac

- `reBot-Isaacsim` + `sim2real-rebot-devarm` already provide USD assets, a
  real→sim UDP mirror, and an HTTP control daemon for this arm. Wire the
  MockArm interface to Isaac Sim (same URDF) for full-physics rehearsal of
  agent episodes before touching hardware.
- **NuRec (neural reconstruction)**: reconstruct the actual demo tabletop
  into a photoreal digital twin; rehearse perception + grasping against the
  twin (domain gap ≈ 0 for the camera), then replay on the real rig. The
  ASPIRE sim2real recipe applies directly: skills discovered in sim transfer
  as *in-context guidance* for the real-robot agent, not as weights.
- **Online adaptation** (Agentic-VLA proper): once a VLA executor exists,
  their GRPO + reward-synthesis loop is the path to improving it from demo
  logs; the trace format already captures per-primitive evidence needed for
  progress rewards.
