"""Object-permanence belief store.

Tracks the last known base-frame position of every object the system has
seen, so the agent can act on things that scrolled out of view or got
occluded ("the mug is where it was 8 seconds ago"). Beliefs decay to
`remembered` state after not being re-observed; they are only dropped after
`forget_after_s` (default: never during a demo run).

Beliefs also carry a named color (median mask HSV, see perception.colors) so
color-word queries like "pink object" resolve against the live world model
even when the detector vocabulary has no such class. All methods are
thread-safe: the WorldWatcher fuses observations from N camera streams while
the skill runtime reads.
